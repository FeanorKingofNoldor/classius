# CLASSIUS POETRY & ART PUBLISHING SYSTEM
## *Community-Curated Arts & Literature*

## Overview

The dual-screen Classius Study combines a traditional B&W e-ink display for text with a color E Ink Gallery 3 display for poetry, art, and visual content. Users can publish their own poetry, curate art collections, and share annotations across all creative content.
