### For Students:
❌ Classical education resources fragmented
❌ Expensive textbooks and translations
❌ Hard to stay motivated (no gamification)
❌ Need tutors for difficult passages (expensive)
❌ Language learning tools separate from reading
❌ No way to track long-term progress

### For Lifelong Learners:
❌ Don't know where to start with classics
❌ No structured path through great books
❌ Modern devices full of distractions
❌ Want deeper engagement than casual reading

### 5.4 REPAIRABILITY SCORE

**Target: iFixit Score of 9/10**

**What we score high on:**
✅ **10/10** - User-replaceable battery (no tools)
✅ **10/10** - Standard screws throughout
✅ **10/10** - Modular design, no glue
✅ **10/10** - Repair documentation freely available
✅ **10/10** - Spare parts sold reasonably
✅ **9/10** - Screen replacement (requires care but doable)
✅ **8/10** - Upgradeable components

**Only points lost:**
⚠️ **-1** - E-ink screens inherently delicate (industry limitation)

**Comparison:**
- Kindle: 2/10 (glued, proprietary, no parts)
- iPad: 3/10 (glued, difficult, expensive)
- Remarkable 2: 7/10 (better, but still proprietary parts)
- **Classius: 9/10** (best-in-class)

- **Stylus** - New stylus technology? Compatible if Wacom standard maintained
- **Software** - Free updates for life of device (10+ years minimum)

**What's NOT Upgradeable (Inherent to Device):**
- Screen resolution (300 PPI is already excellent)
