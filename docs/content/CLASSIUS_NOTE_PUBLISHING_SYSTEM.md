# CLASSIUS NOTE PUBLISHING & OVERLAY SYSTEM

## Overview

Users can publish their notes and annotations on books, creating "note overlays" that other readers can optionally view while reading the same text. This transforms individual reading into a collaborative learning experience where students can follow professors, scholars, and expert readers.

## Core Concept

When reading any book, users can choose to enable note overlays from specific people, seeing their:
- Margin notes
- Highlights with explanations
- Cross-references to other works
- Questions and insights
- Critical analysis

This creates a mentorship experience - like having a professor sitting next to you explaining the text.

## 1. PUBLISHING NOTES

### 1.1 Making Notes Public

**User Control:**
```
For each book, users choose:
○ Private (default) - Only I can see my notes
○ Public - Anyone can view my note overlay
○ Selective - Only approved followers can see
○ Academic - Only verified scholars/professors
```

**What Can Be Published:**
- Handwritten margin notes (OCR'd for searchability)
- Typed annotations
- Highlights with commentary
- Bookmarks with descriptions  
- Cross-references to other passages/books
- Questions and discussion points

**Publishing Process:**
```
1. User completes reading/annotating a book
2. Goes to "My Notes" → "Publish Options"
3. Reviews all notes for that book
4. Selects which notes to make public
5. Adds profile context (expertise, credentials)
6. Publishes with optional introduction
```
