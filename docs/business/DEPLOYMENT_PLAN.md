## Risk Mitigation

**Scholar Outreach Risks:**
- Low response rate → Cast wider net (100+ scholars contacted)
- Negative feedback → Iterate rapidly on feedback
- No big names → Target rising stars and emeritus professors

**Kickstarter Risks:**
- Campaign fails → Pre-sell to scholar network first
- Low funding → Reduce initial feature set
- Manufacturing delays → Build in 3-month buffer

**Competition:**
- Kindle dominates → Focus on specialized features they can't match
- Academic publishers resist → Partner with public domain content first

---

This plan leverages academic credibility first, then uses that validation to build consumer confidence. The scholar beta program is key - it provides both product validation and marketing ammunition for the crowdfunding campaign.
